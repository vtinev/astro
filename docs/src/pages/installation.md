There are a few different ways to install Astro in a new project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - `v12.20.0`, `v14.13.1`, `v16.0.0`, or higher.
- **Text editor** - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with our [Official Astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).
- **Terminal** - Astro is mainly accessed via the terminal's command-line.

For demonstration purposes, we will be using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) in the examples below, but you could also use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) if you prefer an npm alternative.

## Create Astro

`npm init astro` is the easiest way to install Astro in a new project. Run this command in your terminal to start our `create-astro` install wizard to assist you with setting up a new project.

```shell
# With NPM
npm init astro

# Yarn
yarn create astro
```

[`create-astro`](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/tree/main/packages/create-astro) wizard lets you choose from a set of [starter templates](/examples) or alternatively, you could import your own Astro project directly from Github.

```bash
# Note: Replace "my-astro-project" with the name of your project.

# npm 6.x
npm init astro my-astro-project --template starter
# npm 7+ (extra double-dash is needed)
npm init astro my-astro-project -- --template starter
# yarn
yarn create astro my-astro-project --template starter
# Using a third-party template
npm init astro my-astro-project -- --template [GITHUB_USER]/[REPO_NAME]
# Using a third-party template, inside a repo
npm init astro my-astro-project -- --template [GITHUB_USER]/[REPO_NAME]/path/to/template
```

After `create-astro` scaffolds out your project, remember to install your projects dependencies using npm or your package manager of choice. In this example, we'll use npm:

```bash
npm install
```

You can now [Start](#start-astro) your Astro project. Once you have completed assembling your Astro project you can then [Build](#build-astro) your project. Astro would then package up your application and have the static files ready for you to [Deploy](/guides/deploy) to your favourite hosting provider

## Manual Install

You can also setup Astro without the aide of the `create-astro` wizard, below are the few extra steps that are required to get Astro going.

### Set up your project

```bash
# Make and enter a new directory
mkdir my-astro-project
cd my-astro-project
```

Create an empty directory with the name of your project, and then navigate into it:

### Create `package.json`

```bash
# This command will create a basic package.json for you
npm init --yes
```

Astro is designed to work with the entirety of the npm package ecosystem. This is managed by a project manifest at the root of your project known as `package.json` . If you're not familiar with the `package.json` file, we highly recommend you to have a quick read over it on [the npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

### Install Astro

Following the instructions above, you should have a directory with a single `package.json` file inside of it. You can now setup Astro inside your project.

```bash
npm install astro
```

You can now replace the placeholder "scripts" section of your `package.json` file that `npm init` created for you with the following:

```diff
  "scripts": {
-    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
+    "start": "astro dev",
+    "build": "astro build"
  },
}
```

The [`start`](#start-astro) command launches the Astro Dev Server on `http://localhost:3000`. Once your project is ready, the [`build`](#build-astro) command outputs your project to the `dist/` directory. [Read more about deploying Astro in the Deploy guide.](/guides/deploy)

### Create your first page

Astro Open up your favourite text editor, and create a new file in your project:

1. Create a new file at `src/pages/index.astro`
2. Copy-and-paste the following snippet (including `---` dashes) into it.

```astro
---
// JS/TS Code written in between the (---) code fence,
// is ran solely on the Server!
console.log('See me in the Terminal')
---

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

<style lang='scss'>
  body{
    h1{
      color:orange;
    }
  }
</style>

<script>
 // JS Code entered here is ran entirely on the Browser
 console.log('See me in the devTools')
</script>
```

Above is an example of the Astro's Component's Syntax, which comprises of both HTML & JSX.

You can create more pages in the `src/pages` directory, and Astro will use the filename to create new pages on your site. For example, by creating a new file at `src/pages/about.astro` (reusing the previous snippet), Astro will generate a new page at the URL : `http://localhost/about`

## [Start Astro](#start-astro)

```bash
npm start
```

Astro will now start serving your application on `http://localhost:3000`. By opening this URL in your browser, you should see the Astro's ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù

## [Build Astro](#build-astro)

```bash
npm run build
```

This will instruct Astro to build your site and save it directly to disk. Your application is now ready in the `dist/` directory.

## Next Steps

Success! You're now ready to start developing!
